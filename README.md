# file_server

This is just a little hobby project, started out as a simple way to share a directory via http. I did it to learn C and wanted an easy way to download files. Then i started to add features and now it has a ncurses interface, file upload, Partial download, keep-alive and other stuff. Its far from being save or secure in any way, as said, i just did it to learn C. Might clean and improve it in the future, but who knows.
